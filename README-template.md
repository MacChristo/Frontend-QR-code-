### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I learned more about how to use padding, margin and colors when styling the project. It helped me a lot in my css.

### Continued development

I would like to focus more on how to use different color types. I very familiar with rgb colors and hex codes but this project involved the use of hsl color codes which gave me quite a hard time.

### Useful resources

-   [Example resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-radius) - This helped me when I wanted to make the edges of my shape a bit curved. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
-   [Example resource 2](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_hsl.asp) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand HSL color codes. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
-   I'd like to recommend the MDN site or w3schools for anybody involved in programming. They are really great.
